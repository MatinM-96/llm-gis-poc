# LLM–GIS Agent Proof of Concept (PoC)

This project demonstrates how to integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) with a PostGIS spatial database to answer geographic questions using natural language.  
The system uses Azure OpenAI (for example a `gpt-4o-mini` deployment) to translate user queries into SQL, run those queries on PostGIS, and return the results as an interactive table.

Example query:
> “Find 100 residential houses within 200 meters of a river in Kristiansand.”

The goal is to show an end-to-end pipeline from:
**Natural language → LLM planner → Structure plan → SQL → PostGIS → Visualization(map).**

## Installation

#### 1.1 Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatinM-96/NordKart-MasterOppgave.git
cd NordKart-MasterOppgave
```
#### 1.2 Install requirements

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup: Azure OpenAI and database credentials (.env)

All secrets (keys, endpoints, DB connection string) are stored in a `.env` file that is not committed to Git.

#### 2.1 Create `.env` file

In the project root (same folder as `requirements.txt`), create a file named `.env`:

```bash
touch .env
```

Open it in your editor and add:

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY
PGCONN_STRING=postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE
```


#### 2.2 Load and test the environment variables

In a Python shell or Jupyter notebook:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
print("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT =", os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"))
print("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY is set:", os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY") is not None)
print("PGCONN_STRING is set:", os.getenv("PGCONN_STRING") is not None)
```
